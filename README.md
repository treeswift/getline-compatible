# Notes on the `treeswift` fork

This fork of the [original project](https://github.com/jamesderlin/getline-compatible) adds
Meson build files and version tags for easy distro integration; only that and nothing more.

Everything contributed on top of the original project has been released into the public domain.
The original code is covered by the ZLib license, as indicated in the [LICENSE] file.
The original README comes below.

# getline-compatible

Portable implementations of POSIX `getdelim` and `getline` functions for
non-POSIX systems, along with some other line-reading utilities.

## `ggets`/`fggets`

Provides reimplementations of [Chuck Falconer's `ggets` and `fggets`
functions][archived-ggets], versions of `gets` and `fgets` that automatically
allocate a buffer of the necessary size and that always strip any trailing
newline.  These have friendlier syntax than `getline`.

(Note that because they always strip a trailing newline, callers will not be
able to distinguish a final line that contains a newline from a final line that
does not.  Some consider this to be a bug; others consider this to be a
feature.)

## Universal newlines

Additionally provides `getline_univ` and `fggets_univ`, versions that recognize
any of `CR`, `LF`, or `CR-LF` as line endings, regardless of the platform and
of whether the stream has been opened in text or binary modes.  These provide
behavior similar to universal newline support in Python.

## Portability

To try to maximize portability, code is written in C89. (Some exotic systems
might need to explicitly add definitions for `ssize_t` and `SIZE_MAX`.)

## `wchar_t` support

Optionally provides `wchar_t` versions for systems that do not support UTF-8.
Note that `wchar_t` versions require `wchar.h`, which is not available in C89.
